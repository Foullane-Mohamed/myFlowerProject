                  <h3>Monocotyledonous Weeds</h3>
                  <p>
                    Monocotyledonous weeds, such as Crabgrass and Johnson grass,
                    have narrow leaves with parallel veins and a fibrous root
                    system. They are fast-growing and can quickly compete with
                    cultivated plants.

                  <h3>Dicotyledonous Weeds</h3>
                  <p>
                    Dicotyledonous weeds like Dandelion and Broadleaf Plantain are
                    characterized by their broad leaves with branching veins and
                    typically possess taproots. These weeds are known for their
                    adaptability and resilience, thriving in various environments.
                    The broad leaves with branching veins enable them to capture
                    more sunlight, enhancing photosynthesis and promoting rapid
                    growth. Their taproots extend vertically into the soil,
                    providing stability and access to nutrients and water from
                    deeper layers, enhancing their ability to withstand drought
                    and compete with surrounding vegetation. Despite being
                    considered nuisances in agriculture, these weeds play
                    ecological roles, stabilizing soil, cycling nutrients, and
                    supporting biodiversity in natural habitats. Control methods
                    include mechanical (hand-pulling, mowing), chemical (targeted
                    herbicides), and cultural practices (mulching, soil
                    management) to mitigate their impact while preserving
                    ecosystem health.
